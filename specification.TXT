Build an Android app written in Kotlin which uses REST API
(https://gorest.co.in/public-api/todos) to download a list of todos and show them in a list.

Todos should be saved in local storage so users could read them with no network connection.

The items on the list should display titles of todos.

Tapping an item on the list should display a details screen with the title of the corresponding item
and the date when todo was updated. This doesnâ€™t need to look beautiful in terms of UI.

At least some components should be unit tested.

Focus on the scalable modular architecture.

We are interested in your skills and knowledge using databases,
so a database solution is what we expect.
